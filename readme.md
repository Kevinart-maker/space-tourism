for this project, i made use of nextjs and tailwindcss for styling,

it was really fun, i love the unique ui of the website especially the navbar, i was able to achieve that well and make it responsive with some ts conditionals and styling

the slide on the destination page made me think twice, my go to for slides is splidejs, but i thought to myself, was it really necessary for this project? the slide in this project
has a more custom feel to it and that will be a tad bit of a challenge to achieve with a library, so i did it myself with short conditionals...

...i coudn't really the project because i'm working on a new gig i recently got to build an ecommerce site and i also have a deadline there too

i do hope what i've done so far is what you are looking for, thanks!
